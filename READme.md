# Introduction

This is my very first project which finds the weather of any identified area using node.js . 
My motive of working on this project is to learn how to use github. 

# Features

* A request to mapbox.com API is sent to get co-ordinates i.e latitude and longitude of a place
* A request to darksky.com API is sent to fetch real time weather forecast information at a particular location co-ordinate 
* Using node.js these requests are asynchronously called and the data is returned to the user

P.S This app currently doesn't have a front end. Using Express framework it would be created soon
